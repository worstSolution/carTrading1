First of all, install Docker Desktop (Windows 10 Pro required) at: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/

After that, download WSL2 at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package

Open Docker Desktop.

Then open cmd, cd to the folder that contains files downloaded from this repository.

Run the command: docker-compose up
(It would take a long time at first run, and if you have an error at first run, run the command again).

Finally, open your web brower and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
